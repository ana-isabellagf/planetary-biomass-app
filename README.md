# Biomass Analysis App with Streamlit & FastAPI

This application allows users to upload a shapefile (`.zip`) and explore aboveground biomass trends using the **Microsoft Planetary Computer** and custom spatial queries from a **PostGIS** database. It is composed of:

- A **FastAPI** backend that handles file uploads, spatial analysis, and biomass extraction
- A **Streamlit** frontend that visualizes the results, including maps and time series
- Integration with [Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/) for biomass data

---

## How It Works

1. User uploads a shapefile via Streamlit UI
2. Streamlit sends the shapefile to a FastAPI endpoint
3. The backend:
   - Clips biomass rasters using the AOI
   - Computes mean biomass by year
   - Queries spatial metadata (country, ecological zone, protected areas) from PostGIS
4. The results are returned and visualized on the map and time series chart

## How to Run

### 1. Create and activate environment

```bash
conda create -n fastapi-env python=3.12
conda activate fastapi-env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Launch the application

Use the batch script:

```bash
scripts/start_services.bat
```

This will:
- Start FastAPI at `http://localhost:8000`
- Open Streamlit UI at `http://localhost:8501`

## Example Result

- Biomass values from the **Chloris-biomass** dataset (2003â€“2019)
- Map rendered with **Esri World Imagery** and uploaded AOI
- Time series plot generated from mean biomass per year
- Additional info:
  - Country name
  - Ecological zone
  - Overlapping protected areas

## Data Sources

- **Microsoft Planetary Computer** â€” [Chloris-biomass](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog/chloris-biomass)
- **PostGIS** â€” Spatial layers: countries, protected areas, ecological zones
